# UI Development Guidelines

This document outlines the architectural and stylistic standards for UI development. It distinguishes between atomic "Widgets" and complex "Components" to maintain a clean project structure.

## 1. UI Taxonomy & Definitions

We classify UI elements into two distinct categories based on complexity and responsibility.

### **Widgets**
* **Definition:** Low-level, atomic UI elements.
* **Scope:** Highly reusable, generic, and usually small in logic.
* **Examples:** `AppButton`, `CustomTextField`, `TagChip`, `LoadingSpinner`.

### **Components**
* **Definition:** A group of widgets that form a complex UI tree or a distinct section of a screen.
* **Scope:** Specific to a feature or use case, often composing multiple "Widgets" together.
* **Examples:** `UserProfileHeader` (subscreen), `TransactionHistoryList`, `RegistrationForm`.

## 2. Directory Structure

Each feature module should organize its UI elements into these specific folders based on the taxonomy above:

* **`.../presentation/widget/`**
    * Place low-level, atomic items here.
* **`.../presentation/components/`**
    * Place complex UI compositions and subscreens here.
* **`.../presentation/modal/`**
    * Place feature-specific Modals here.
* **`.../presentation/dialog/`**
    * Place feature-specific Dialogs here.

## 3. General Implementation Rules

These rules apply to both Widgets and Components:

* **Stateless by Default:** Avoid using `StatefulWidget` unless strictly necessary (e.g., for `AnimationController` or complex local lifecycle).
* **One Class, One File:** Do not define multiple widget classes in the same file. Create a new file for every Widget or Component.
* **No Function Components:** Never use helper functions (e.g., `Widget buildHeader() {...}`) to return UI. Always create a separate `StatelessWidget` class.

## 4. Design System

* **Typography:** All text styles **must** come from `AppTypography`.
* **Colors:** All colors **must** come from `AppColors`.
    * *Prohibited:* Hardcoded hex values or standard Flutter colors (e.g., `Colors.blue`).

## 5. Modals and Dialogs

### Structure
* **Wrappers:**
    * **Modals:** Must be wrapped with the `BaseModalParent` class.
    * **Dialogs:** Must be wrapped with the `BaseDialogParent` class.
* **State:** Modals and Dialogs should be `StatelessWidget` unless otherwise necessary.

### Triggering
* Implement a `static` method inside the class to handle the display logic.
* **Modals:** Call `ModalHelper.show(...)`.
* **Dialogs:** Call `DialogHelper.show(...)`.

### Quick Checklist
- [ ] Is this a low-level `Widget` or a complex `Component`? (Check folder placement).
- [ ] Is the class defined in its own file?
- [ ] Are function components avoided?
- [ ] Are `AppColors` and `AppTypography` used exclusively?
