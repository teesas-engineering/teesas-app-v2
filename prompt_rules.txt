1. avoid using stateful widget unless it is necessary
2. avoid having multiple widget classes in the same file, create a new file for each widget, under the /widget folder
3. avoid using a function component
4. all textstyles should come from the app context.appStyles
5. All colors should come from the context.appColors
6. when creating a Modal, use the standard modal approach from the project
7. Wrap the Modal with the BaseModalParent class
8. All modals should be a stateless widget unless it is necessary to be otherwise
9. use a static method to show the modal, it should call the ModalHelper.show method
10. Modal rules will be just the same for dialog, but we should use BaseDialogParent class and DialogHelper.show method
11. all modals should be uder the Presentation/Modal folder and dialogs should be under Presentation/Dialog folder
12. Use a store to manage the state of the app, if you need an integer state, please use the tab_store.dart file and a boolean state, please use the toggle_store.dart file
13. When using a shared store, make sure to Provide it for the scope of the widget that needs it.
14. to open a screen, use context.push or context.pushReplacement if the prompt demands it.
15. For a screen that uses appBar, you can use the BaseScaffold.withLightAppbar, if the screen has a complex appBar then create a new scaffold and implement the appBar

Good luck coding.
